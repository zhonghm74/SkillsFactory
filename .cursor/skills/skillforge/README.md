# SkillForge v5.1

**From Art to Engineering: A Manifesto for AI Skill Creation.**

## The Problem

The central challenge in AI development isn't a lack of ideas, but the inconsistent process of turning them into robust, reliable skills. Current methods are often ad-hoc, brittle, and difficult to scale—resembling more of an art form than a predictable engineering discipline.

---

## The Solution

**Quality is built in, not bolted on.**

SkillForge is a methodology where rigor is integrated into every step of the creation process, from initial conception to final validation. It's a fundamental shift from reactive testing to proactive engineering.

## What's New in v5.1

v5.1 builds on the v5.0 context-efficient redesign and adds stronger frontmatter support, hooks guidance, validation coverage, and packaging safety.

### Context-Efficient Foundation (v5.0)

The foundation from v5.0 remains: **the context window is a public good.** Every line in SKILL.md competes with the user's actual work.

- **SKILL.md slimmed from 872 to 313 lines** (64% reduction)
- Deep dives moved to `references/` where they're loaded only when needed
- Triggers moved into `description` field for pre-load routing

### Simplified Frontmatter

Skills now use only `name` and `description` in frontmatter. The `description` field is the primary triggering mechanism — it determines when a skill activates, so all "when to use" information belongs there.

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it. Include trigger scenarios.
---
```

### Degrees of Freedom

A new design concept for matching instruction specificity to task fragility:

- **High freedom** (text guidance) — when multiple approaches are valid
- **Medium freedom** (pseudocode/parameterized scripts) — when a preferred pattern exists
- **Low freedom** (exact scripts) — when operations are fragile and error-prone

### Scaffold Script

New `init_skill.py` creates rich skill templates with TODO placeholders, organizational pattern suggestions, and example resource files:

```bash
python scripts/init_skill.py my-new-skill --path ~/.codex/skills
```

### Iteration as a Formal Step

Iteration is now built into Phase 3. Skills improve through real usage, not just synthesis panel review.

### Extended Frontmatter + Hooks (v5.1)

v5.1 expands skill metadata support and documentation:

- Extended frontmatter coverage for `model`, `context`, `agent`, `hooks`, and `user-invocable`
- New hooks integration guidance for `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and `Stop`
- Template updates for modern skill authoring defaults

### Validation + Packaging Hardening (v5.1)

v5.1 adds stronger guardrails for safe distribution:

- Shared validation constants across validation scripts
- Improved frontmatter parsing and stricter structure checks
- `.skillignore` enforcement restored in packaging
- Docs safety checker to flag unsafe command interpolation patterns
- Regression test coverage for packaging exclusions

## The 4-Phase Architecture

SkillForge implements its philosophy through a rigorous, autonomous 4-phase architecture. This structure ensures that every skill undergoes comprehensive analysis, thorough specification, clean generation, and objective approval before it is complete.

![4-Phase Architecture](assets/images/04-four-phase-architecture.png)

---

## Phase 0: Skill Triage

Before creating anything, SkillForge analyzes your input to determine the best action:

- **USE_EXISTING** — Existing skill handles this perfectly (match ≥80%)
- **IMPROVE_EXISTING** — Existing skill is close but needs enhancement (match 50-79%)
- **CREATE_NEW** — No good match, create new skill (match <50%)
- **COMPOSE** — Multiple skills needed, suggest chain

```bash
# These all work - SkillForge routes automatically:

SkillForge: create a skill for automated code review
→ Creates new skill (Phase 1-4)

help me debug this TypeError
→ Recommends debugging skills

do I have a skill for Excel?
→ Searches and recommends matching skills
```

---

## Phase 1: Deep Analysis

**Maximum depth before a single line is generated.**

Every problem is systematically deconstructed through **11 distinct thinking lenses**, with degrees of freedom assessed for each design decision.

![Phase 1: Thinking Lenses](assets/images/05-phase1-thinking-lenses.png)

The 11 lenses include: First Principles, Inversion, Second-Order Effects, Pre-Mortem, Systems Thinking, Devil's Advocate, Constraints, Pareto, Root Cause, Comparative, and Opportunity Cost.

---

## Phases 2 & 3: Specification & Generation

**Translating deep analysis into a flawless build.**

The insights from analysis are codified into a structured XML specification, then used to generate the skill with fresh context. Phase 3 now includes an explicit **iteration step** — review output against spec, identify gaps, and refine before panel review.

![Phases 2 & 3](assets/images/06-phases-2-3.png)

---

## Phase 4: Multi-Agent Synthesis

**A panel of experts demands unanimous approval.**

A generated skill is submitted to a panel of specialized agents, each evaluating against distinct criteria. **Approval must be unanimous.**

![Phase 4: Multi-Agent Synthesis](assets/images/07-phase4-synthesis.png)

The panel includes:
- **Design/Architecture Agent** — Structure, patterns, correctness
- **Audience/Usability Agent** — Clarity, discoverability, completeness
- **Evolution Agent** — Timelessness, extensibility, future-readiness (score ≥7/10 required)
- **Script Agent** (conditional) — Validates code quality when scripts are present

---

## Evolution Mandate

Skill quality is not enough on day one. The system must stay maintainable and extensible as the skill ecosystem grows.

![Evolution Mandate](assets/images/08-evolution-mandate.png)

---

## Three Core Principles

![Core Principles](assets/images/09-core-principles.png)

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Engineer for Agents** | Standardized directory structure, simplified frontmatter, automated validation |
| **Systematize Rigor** | 4-phase architecture, regression questioning, 11 thinking lenses, multi-agent synthesis |
| **Design for Evolution** | Dedicated Evolution agent, mandatory ≥7/10 timelessness score, degrees of freedom assessment |

## Agentic Capabilities

SkillForge is designed so skills can execute repeatable work, validate outputs, and support autonomous operation where appropriate.
