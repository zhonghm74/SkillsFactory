# Frontend Review

Review UI code with a pre-merge mindset. Findings come first. Focus on behavior regressions, accessibility gaps, risky form handling, unsafe rendering, and missing user states.

## Workflow

1. Identify the UI surface and user flows affected.
2. Check accessibility, security-sensitive inputs, loading states, and error states.
3. Report findings by severity with concrete code references.
4. Prefer actionable fixes over generic advice.

## Output Contract

- Start with findings, ordered by severity.
- Include file references for each finding.
- Call out open questions separately from confirmed issues.
- If there are no findings, say that explicitly and note residual risks or test gaps.
