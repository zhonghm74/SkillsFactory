## Current Promotion Decisions

| Target | Decision | Winner | Causes | Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `yao-meta-skill` | `keep_current` | `Current` | no_candidate_outperformed_current | Keep the current description and open a new candidate only when fresh route evidence appears. |
| `team-frontend-review` | `keep_current` | `Current` | no_candidate_outperformed_current, current_holdout_risk | Keep the current description and open a new candidate only when fresh route evidence appears. |
| `governed-incident-command` | `keep_current` | `Current` | no_candidate_outperformed_current, current_holdout_gap_present, current_holdout_risk | Keep the current description and open a new candidate only when fresh route evidence appears. |
